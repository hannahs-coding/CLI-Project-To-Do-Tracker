# CLI Project: To-Do Tracker
The To Do Tracker is a CLI-Based coding project designed for tracking a user's to-do tasks. I created this project because I sometimes procrastinate to the point of not completing a task.

## ⚠️Warning⚠️
This project has some bugs. Also, using code from this repository as a class assignment, for a hackathon, and for an internshipis is prohibited.
